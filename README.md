Xignite SDK for Java 17+

This is not the official Java SDK for Xignite API. Should be replaced when xignite release their maven dependency

it is forked from the official repository so that it can be used in the project as a dependency.

It is a simple to use, yet powerful library that allows you to access Xignite API from your Java application.

Find the official SDK and see here [http://xignite.github.io/JavaSDK](http://xignite.github.io/JavaSDK/) for details.

Add the below properties in your project

xignite:
    api-token: <xignite-api-token>
    sdkVersion: <official-xignite-sdk-version, currently it is 1.1.4.9>
