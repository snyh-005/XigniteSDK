Xignite SDK for Java 17+

This is not the official Java SDK for Xignite API.

it is forked from the official repository so that it can be used in the project as a dependency.

It is a simple to use, yet powerful library that allows you to access Xignite API from your Java application.

Find the official SDK and see here [http://xignite.github.io/JavaSDK](http://xignite.github.io/JavaSDK/) for details.
